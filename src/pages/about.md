Hello, my name is Aurora Walberg. I'm a full-stack cloud developer from Norway. I'm skilled in multiple technologies and domains such as React, Angular, .NET, and Azure, and have recently gained a great interest in web development specifically.

I hold a bachelor's degree in Robotics and Intelligent Systems, with knowledge of engineering mathematics, robotics, algorithms, data structures, and computer architecture. After working for a couple of years at a financial technology startup, I'm continuing to develop as a consultant at Inmeta.

Currently I'm working a lot on projects using React Server Components and the Next.js 13 App Router.
