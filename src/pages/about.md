Hello, my name is Aurora Scharff. I'm a Software Engineer from Norway and Microsoft MVP in Web Technologies, skilled in multiple technologies and domains such as React, Next.js, .NET, and Azure.

Currently, I serve as a consultant at Crayon Consulting, while also contributing as React Certification Lead at certificates.dev. I focus on web development with extensive experience in React and Next.js, including active use of React Server Components.

I also write React-focused blog content on [certificates.dev](https://certificates.dev/blog?tech=react), covering modern React patterns and best practices.

I enjoy solving problems, learning new things, and sharing knowledge through workshops, technical blog posts, social media, demo applications, and supporting fellow developers. I also regularly present internationally at recognized conferences.

In addition to my regular work, I offer consulting services to help businesses with their Next.js and React development.

If you have any questions or inquiries, feel free to reach out to me on X or LinkedIn.
