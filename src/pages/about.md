Hey, I'm Aurora Scharff ♡

I'm a Software Engineer from Norway and Microsoft MVP in Web Technologies, skilled in multiple technologies and domains, including React, Next.js, .NET, and Azure.

I work as a consultant at [Crayon Consulting](https://crayonconsulting.no) and I'm the React Certification Lead at [certificates.dev](https://certificates.dev). My focus is web development with extensive experience in React and Next.js, including active use of React Server Components.

I also write React-focused blog content on [certificates.dev/blog](https://certificates.dev/blog?tech=react), covering modern React patterns and best practices.

I enjoy solving problems, learning new things, and sharing knowledge through workshops, blog posts, demo apps, and supporting fellow developers. I regularly present at international conferences too.

**Want to work together?** I offer consulting services to help with Next.js and React development. Feel free to reach out on X or LinkedIn!
