description: "RedwoodSDK v1 redefines full-stack React development by embracing web standards without compromise. Built as a lightweight toolkit rather than a heavy framework, it gives developers direct control through simple route functions that handle native Requests and Responsesâ€”whether rendering UI, streaming data, or upgrading protocols. This approach eliminates hidden magic while seamlessly supporting SSR, client-side React, and Server Components."
