description: "We’re excited to announce RedwoodSDK—a full-stack React framework that strips web development back to its essentials: “Webdev, the good parts.” It’s TypeScript-only, with no type generation or transpilation magic. It’s composable, so routes, server functions, and React Server Components fit together without hidden layers or lock-in. And it’s built on web standards, giving you native access to Request and Response for routing, rendering, and streaming."
