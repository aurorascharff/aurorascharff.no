Released with React 19, the `cache()` API is a new feature that allows you to cache the result of a data fetch or commutation. It's meant to be used with React Server Component, but has not gotten that much attention. In this blog post, I will show you how to use `cache()` to preload data to optimize performance, avoiding server component waterfalls.

## Table of contents

## The Use Case

let's say we have a server component, here in the Next.js App Router, `PostsPage`. It receives a parameter from the URL and renders a `Post` component.

```tsx
export default async function PostPage({ params }: { params: Promise<{ postId: string }> }) {
  const { postId } = await params;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Post: {postId}</h1>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading post...</div>}>
        <Post postId={postId} />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Here is the `Posts` component. It fetched a specific post, and also renders a list of comments for that post.

```tsx
async function Post({ postId }: { postId: string }) {
  const post = await getPost(postId);

  return (
    <div className="rounded border-2 border-blue-500 p-4">
      <h2>Title: {post?.title}</h2>
      Post comments:
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading comments...</div>}>
        <Comments postId={postId} />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The `Comments` component fetches the comments for the post:

```tsx
async function Comments({ postId }: { postId: string }) {
  const comments = await getComments(postId);

  return (
    <div className="rounded border-2 border-slate-500 p-4">
      <h2>Comments</h2>
      <ul>
        {comments.map(comment => {
          return <li key={comment.id}>{comment.body}</li>;
        })}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Both `Posts` and `Comments` are server components, and they are both fetching their own data. This is nice, because each component is responsible for both its data and its UI, maintaining composition. However, the comments can not start fetching it's data before `Post` is done running the await to fetch its data, even though `Comments` does not depend on data fetched by the `Posts` component. It's "locked" inside the `Posts` component, leading to a server waterfall.

Frameworks like React Router v7 and TanStack start solve this problem with loaders, ensuring all data is fetched based on the route. However, in Next.js, we don't have this automatic optimization.

## The React Cache API

The React `cache()` API is a new feature in React 19. It allows you to cache the result of a data fetch or commutation. It's meant to be used for server components, but has not gotten that much attention. The [React docs](https://react.dev/reference/react/cache) contain great examples on how to use it.

Typically, it's used to enable per-render caching/memoization for data fetches across server components. A classic example could be something like a `getUser` function:

```tsx
const getUser = cache(async (userId: string) => {
  const response = await db.getUser(userId);
});
```

It's likely you are calling `getUser` in multiple server components. By using `cache()`, you can avoid fetching the same data multiple times, and rather share the return value, improving performance. The `cache()` API also allows us to keep the data fetching inside the components.Without this API, we have to hoist data fetching to a higher component to achieve the same performance, breaking composition.

However, the `cache()` API can also be used to avoid be used to preload data. Let's see how we can use it to avoid server component waterfalls.

## The Solution

Since the `cache()` API allows us to cache the result of a data fetch, we can use it to preload data for the `Comments` component. Let's say our data fetching functions look like this:

```tsx
const getPost = async (postId: string) => {
  await new Promise(resolve => {
    return setTimeout(resolve, 1000);
  });
  return [
    {
      body: 'This is the first post on this blog.',
      id: 1,
      title: 'Hello World',
    },
    ...]
    .find(post => {
    return post.id.toString() === postId;
  });
};
```

```tsx
const getComments = async (postId: string) => {
  await new Promise(resolve => {
    return setTimeout(resolve, 1000);
  });
  return [
    {
      body: 'This is the first comment on this blog.',
      id: 1,
      postId: 1,
    },
    ...].filter(comment => {
    return comment.postId.toString() === postId;
  });
};
```

When running our app, it will take 1 second to render the `Post` component, and another second to render the `Comments` component. This is because the `Comments` component is waiting for the `Post` component to finish fetching its data.

Let's use the `cache()` API to preload the data for the `Comments` component. Let's wrap `getComments` in a `cache()` call:

```tsx
// When using cache(), the return value can be cached/memoized per render across multiple server components
const getComments = cache(async (postId: string) => {
  await new Promise(resolve => {
    return setTimeout(resolve, 1000);
  });
  return [
    {
      body: 'This is the first comment on this blog.',
      id: 1,
      postId: 1,
    },
    ...].filter(comment => {
    return comment.postId.toString() === postId;
  });
});
```

Now, we can trigger the data fetch in a higher up component, in this case the `PostsPage`. It could be any component where the necessary arguments for the data fetch are available. However, to avoid blocking our `PostsPage` component, we should not await the promise:

```tsx
export default async function PostPage({ params }: { params: Promise<{ postId: string }> }) {
  const { postId } = await params;

  // Prefetch the comments, but don't await the promise, so it doesn't block rendering
  getComments(postId);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Post: {postId}</h1>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading post...</div>}>
        <Post postId={postId} />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now, the `Comments` component can reuse the preloaded data already triggered by the `PostsPage` component. In our example, since both promises are resolved after 1 second, the `Comments` component will render immediately after the `Post` component, skipping the waterfall.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, I've shown you how to use React `cache()` to optimize performance and avoid server component waterfalls in React Server Components. By preloading data in a higher up component, we will not trigger a waterfall of data fetching and a Server Component can reuse the preloaded data.
