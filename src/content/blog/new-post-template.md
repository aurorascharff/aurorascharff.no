<!-- STYLE NOTES FOR AI:
- Match Aurora's writing style: flowing prose, no short punchy sentences
- No em dashes, use colons or commas instead
- No emojis in prose (only in the sign-off 🚀)
- Don't over-explain, let code speak for itself
- Simplify code examples: abstract away CSS/styling, use generic HTML when possible
- Use // ... to collapse non-essential parts of code
- Don't repeat links already introduced earlier
- Key takeaways should be general principles, not example-specific
- Conclusion should add new value, not repeat earlier content
- Use correct terminology for the topic (check official docs if unsure)
- Read existing posts for reference style before writing

- Multiple examples: use ## for each example, ### for sub-steps, keep structure consistent across examples
- Problem/solution: present the issue, walk through approaches
- Mix of prose, code, and images/gifs as needed
