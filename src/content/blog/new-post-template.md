<!-- STYLE NOTES FOR AI:
- Match Aurora's writing style: flowing prose, no short punchy sentences
- No em dashes, use colons or commas instead
- No emojis in prose (only in the sign-off 🚀)
- Don't over-explain, let code speak for itself
- Simplify code examples: abstract away CSS/styling, use generic HTML when possible
- Use // ... or /* ... */ to collapse non-essential parts of code
- Don't repeat links already introduced earlier
- Don't repeat exact phrases or sentences across sections
- Avoid saying the same thing twice with different wording in adjacent paragraphs
- Key takeaways should be general principles, not example-specific
- Conclusion should add new value, not repeat earlier content
- Use correct terminology for the topic (check official docs if unsure)
- Read existing posts for reference style before writing
- When building multiple parallel examples, keep structure consistent but vary the prose
  (e.g. don't use identical transition sentences between each example's sections)
- Progressive sections should use generic examples; specific use cases belong in Usage sections
- Usage section intros should be conversational: "Let's say we wanted to X in a Y, where..."

IMAGES & GIFS:
- Place GIFs in src/assets/ (e.g. src/assets/my-demo.gif)
- Reference with: ![Alt text describing the demo](@assets/my-demo.gif)
-->

Introductory paragraph setting context. Reference previous work or relevant background if applicable.

## Table of contents

## First Section

Content and code examples...

```tsx
// code example
```

<!--
Structure options depending on the post:
- Linear walkthrough with sequential sections
- Incremental build-up: start basic, add features step by step with subsections (###)
- Multiple examples: use ## for each example, ### for sub-steps, keep structure consistent across examples
- Problem/solution: present the issue, walk through approaches
- Mix of prose, code, and images/gifs as needed
-->

## Conclusion

Final thoughts, forward-looking content, or links to related talks/resources.
